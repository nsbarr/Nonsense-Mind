{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LbbrZEX1EI" %}

## I

So we have your question now, What am I doing here? Is that your question, now, What am I doing here?&#x20;

Well, I’m sitting on a chair. Or I’m listening… I’m listening to crazy talk. \[laughter] Nonsense, nonsense crazy talk.

Anyway. I’m sitting on a chair. Or, I’m listening to a talk.&#x20;

\[he laughs] Yeti from Nepal. Yeti? Snowball man. Snowball man from Nepal. Anyway. Talking from the throne. Anyway.

\[he laughs] Snowball man. \[laughter]. From Mount Everest.

Anyway. So: I am listening to a talk, or sitting on a chair. Or I’m sitting on the throne, giving a talk. Crazy talk.

## II.

So we see “I”, “I’m sitting on a chair,” or listening to a talk, we see the appearance of a real “I” is there. A real “I” abiding or existing in this body.&#x20;

Without examining then, you see, the natural beliefs that, as I mentioned the other day, inside the chest. Not in the stomach, where there’s all the… junks. Junks? Well the, if it’s after lunch or dinner, you know, joking, but not in the stomach, with the food, all the junks, the poopoo \[laughter] not there, but not inside the head. Not here, inside the head \[holding head forward in both hands] or inside the face, you see, not there you see, but inside the chest.
