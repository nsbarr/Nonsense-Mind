# I. Yeti from Nepal

> So we have your question now, What am I doing here? Is that your question, now, What am I doing here?&#x20;

I don’t know the context behind this talk – someone at FPMT might. But it sounds like a Q\&A, like Rinpoche is responding to someone’s question rather than having a talk prepared. Just like the Heart Sutra.

I wonder what the question was. “What am I doing here?” feels a little too abstract to be someone's authentic question. We might ask “how” we came to be here or “why” we’re here, but who among us wonders, “what am I doing here?” That answer is always patently obvious.

Maybe it's that obviousness that provides the context behind the question. There’s a claim that Buddhism seems to make that goes along the lines of “there is no self,” to which we would all have the immediate and invincible retort, well if there’s no self, then what am I doing here?&#x20;

So let’s imagine the question leading up to Rinpoche’s teaching as something like: “You talk about emptiness and non-self. Then: what am I doing here in this meditation hall? Are you saying all this is a hallucination?”

Indeed, the words “non-self” and “emptiness” are two of the most enraging in the Buddhist lexicon. For non-practitioners, these words are immediate turn-offs, red flags even. A religion about emptiness? Count me out! And among practitioners, reactions are mixed. Some people try and come up with alternatives that are more palatable to the modern Western mind. How about infinite potential, or the groundless ground? Do those sound more enticing?

Others, and I count myself in this camp, find that “emptiness” is perfect precisely _because_ of the confusion and outrage it provokes. Common sense recoils at the idea. And that’s the direction this talk leans in. Rinpoche wants us to use our common sense in this talk. We are going to hold onto our common sense like a wild horse and let it gallop around for as long as it needs to until it eventually tires and looking around realizes it has no idea where it is.&#x20;

There is so little in the way of “prerequisites” for the talk, except maybe for the aggregates, which we’ll cover in the commentary. One doesn’t even need to know how to meditate, although having skill at sustaining close attention will of course sharpen our senses.&#x20;
